### Overview

This project presents an in-depth SQL-driven analysis of Netflix’s Movies and TV Shows dataset. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights about global content trends, audience preferences, release patterns, and metadata quality. By leveraging SQL queries, the project answers real business questions and highlights how streaming platforms can optimize their content strategy using data.

The analysis explores various dimensions such as content distribution, ratings, release timelines, country contributions, genre diversity, actor/director participation, and keyword-based content classification.

### Objectives

--Examine the distribution and growth trends of Netflix Movies and TV Shows.

--Determine common industry ratings and identify patterns across content categories.

--Analyze content based on release year, country of origin, duration, and genre.

--Explore the involvement of popular actors and directors, including region-specific insights.

--Identify metadata gaps, such as missing directors or incomplete entries.

--Categorize and classify content based on themes, keywords, and description analysis.

--Provide data-driven insights to support decision-making for content acquisition and curation.
